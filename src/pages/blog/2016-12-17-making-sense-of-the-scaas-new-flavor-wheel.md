The first update for our Knackelibang website! It might not be something super special, and its still missing a few visuals and tweeks, but its functional! and that's what counts. Here, we hope to keep up to date on all out future projects and ideas, and whatever comes next for our company! Hope you enjoy it! For whoever will actually read this first post, which I find will have a rather large chance of beeing "No-one" for quite a while. We have to get noticed first and we are quite a bit a way from that just yet. Staying positive!

As for now, we are waiting for the final step to become a official company and planning out our starting project of DioLight. 

As for now, we plan to "just" make a very, very small vertical-slice of the game, that only contains four things: Player controls, multiplayer possibility, enemies and ONE level, from there we will then build on more and more.

You can checkout some smaller details of the game so far on the Games page, but it will be updated more as we go on! Also more post about our game, the design process we have etc.

Have a great week!
