# DioLight(?)

DioLight is at it's its core a coop FPS in the same vein as Left-4-Dead, with a focus on high moveability, overpowered weapons and gigantic swarm of enemies. The player must together navigate a surreal world-scape, finding and hunting down special enemies! 

Let the hunt begin!

## DioLight Design Road

As our first game-project at Knackelibang, DioLight is partly made as a "test-bed" for crazier ideas and mechanics for a possible larger project down the road. 

Here is a short visual-map of how our idea has evolved to DioLight. It started of as a completely different project and genre, starting as a Tower Defence game, to becoming a Left-4-Dead like FPS with a twist!

# Test Visuals, Designs etc.

All images here only show a glints behind the scenes as work-in-progress stuff, and so far most likely everything will be changes as we go along.

## Some Concepts

## Test Environment Screenshots

Some ideas for level-designs! We aim for a rather odd surrealistic feel.
